Pickles can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients.  Gherkin language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder.  This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

Why stop with just the features though?  Pickles can also read plain text files written in the Markdown format so you can add other files to your feature to add all sorts of context.  Well-written features are great to have but even the best written features can leave out some important context information.  Markdown is very simple to write and is designed to be easily read even in plain text files so they are a great way of adding additional context to your feature files to turn them into a real set of living documentation.
