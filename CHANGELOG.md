# CHANGE LOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). We consider the following to be the API of Pickles for the purposes of Semantic Versioning:

  - The arguments of the command line runner
  - The arguments of the PowerShell runner
  - The arguments of the MSBuild configuration
  - The settings file of the GUI runner
  - The JSON output of the JSON format

Features in Experimental are subject to change and removal without being considered breaking.

## [1.2.3] - 2015-10-06

### Fixed

- In the DHtml version, the alignment of the keywords (Given, When, Then) was fixed for non-English languages ([#219](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/219))

## [0.20.0] - 2014-12-10

### Added

- The command line and powershell runners now return an error code of 0 when everything went fine, and 1 if there was an error.
- The HTML and DHTML output versions no longer horizontally spread tables.
- The GUI version has an icon

### Changed

### Added

- Allow multiple result files ([#83](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/83)): it is now possible to use multiple test result files.

## [0.14.0] - 2014-03-27

### Added

- The (static) Html version now supports images with .png, .gif, .jpg and .bmp extensions. This partially addresses issue ([#12](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/12))
- Several updates of external dependencies, including the long out-of-date IKVM. Yay!
- All production code and test code now use the excellent [System.IO.Abstraction](https://github.com/tathamoddie/System.IO.Abstractions) library and its TestingHelpers classes.
- We are using build services provided by [MyGet](http://www.myget.org/)


## [0.13.1] - 2013-12-20

- DHTML uses the Feature's description for the Background ([#74](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/74))
- Nuget manifest should mention PicklesDoc instead of only Jeffrey Cameron ([#84](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/84))
- Crash when a feature is not present in the test result (with NUnit) ([#85](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/85))


## [0.13.0] - 2013-11-29

### Added

- The UI version now includes the option to generate each selected output format in its own directory ([#78](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/78))

## [0.12.1] - 2013-10-28

### Fixed

- Fixes a .NET runtime version issue caused by combining all Pickles runners in one directory. We are back to each runner in a separate directory, and will likely remain so until all assemblies use the same .NET framework version.


## [0.12.0] - 2013-10-25

### Added

- DHTML output format should render Markdown correctly (one step closer toward feature parity for all export formats) ([#60](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/60))

### Changed

- The .zip file contains all 5 Pickles runners in one directory, reducing the size of the download by roughly three quarters.

## [0.10.0] - 2013-08-29

### Added

- Add support for SpecRun test results ([#21](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/21)). Refer to the wiki page for instructions on how to configure SpecRun correctly: [Integrating Test Results From SpecRun](http://www.picklesdoc.com/#!Pages/IntegratingTestResultsFromSpecRun.md).

### Fixed

- Please implement marking ignored test cases with yellow sign rather than red for all Test Result providers (not just MSTest) ([#47](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/47))
